## Quick Start for New Users

### Step 1: Understand the File Structure

Your system is organized like this:

```
DET.StudentAccountAutomation/
├── Scripts/                    ← All the program files live here
│   ├── config.json            ← Main configuration file (YOU EDIT THIS)
│   ├── config.json.template   ← Template to help you set up config.json
│   └── Logs/                  ← Daily log files appear here
├── Archived/             ← Student data files stored here
│   ├── MasterStudentData.csv  ← Main student database
│   ├── DailyDownloads/        ← Daily downloads from eduSTAR
│   └── ArchivedCurrentData/   ← Backup copies of student data
└── StudentsByYearLevel/       ← Class lists organized by year
    ├── Year_00/               ← Prep class lists
    ├── Year_01/               ← Year 1 class lists
    └── ...                    ← And so on
```

### Step 2: Initial Setup

1. **Copy the template:** Rename `config.json.template` to `config.json`
2. **Edit your settings:** Open `config.json` and update it for your school
3. **Test first:** Always start with Mock Mode enabled
4. **Go live:** Once testing is successful, disable Mock Mode

### Step 3: First Run

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to the Scripts folder
3. Run: `.\Process-DailyStudentUpdates.ps1`
4. Check the email report and log files

## Configuration Template Setup

### Essential Settings You Must Change

#### 1. School Information

```json
"SchoolSettings": {
  "SchoolNumber": "8881",           ← Your 4-digit school number
  "SchoolName": "Sample Primary School"  ← Your school's full name
}
```

#### 2. Email Notifications

```json
"EmailNotification": {
  "Enabled": true,
  "To": "admin@yourschool.vic.edu.au;ict@yourschool.vic.edu.au",

}
```

#### 3. Safety Settings (Important!)

  "MockMode": true,              ← ALWAYS start with true for testing
  "TestEmail": "test@yourschool.vic.edu.au",
  "RemoveQuotesFromCsv": true
}
```

### Optional Settings You Can Adjust

#### File Cleanup

```json
"CleanupSettings": {
  "Enabled": true,
  "RunOnDayOfWeek": "Monday",      ← When to clean up old files
  "RetentionDaysLogs": 7,          ← Keep log files for 7 days
  "RetentionDaysArchives": 7       ← Keep archived data for 7 days
}
```

## Running the System

### Manual Testing (Recommended First)

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
2. **Navigate to Scripts folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd "G:\Shared drives\...\DET.StudentAccountAutomation\Scripts"
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```powershell
   .\Process-DailyStudentUpdates.ps1
   ```
4. **Watch the output** and check for any errors
5. **Review the email report** that gets sent
6. **Check the log file** in the Logs folder

### Setting Up Daily Automation

Once testing is successful, set up Windows Task Scheduler:

1. **Open Task Scheduler**
2. **Create Basic Task**

   - **Name:** "Daily Student Account Updates"
   - **Trigger:** Daily at 3:00 AM (or preferred time)
   - **Action:** Start a program
   - **Program:** `powershell.exe`
   - **Arguments:** `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "G:\...\Scripts\Process-DailyStudentUpdates.ps1"`
   - **Start in:** `G:\...\Scripts\`

3. **Configure Security**
   - Run whether user is logged on or not
   - Run with highest privileges
   - Use a service account with appropriate permissions

## Understanding Email Reports

### Success Email Example

```
✅ SUCCESS - Daily Student Update Report - Your School - 2025-07-30

📊 SUMMARY STATISTICS:
• New Students: 3
• Departed Students: 1
• Existing Students: 245
• Accounts Created: 3

📋 PROCESSING DETAILS:
[Detailed log of what happened]

🎉 All tasks completed successfully!
```

### What the Numbers Mean

- **New Students:** Students found in eduSTAR but not in your local database
- **Departed Students:** Students in your local database but no longer in eduSTAR
- **Existing Students:** Students who remain enrolled
- **Accounts Created:** New accounts that were set up with passwords and services

### Warning Signs in Reports

- ❌ **FAILED** in the subject line means something went wrong
- High numbers of departed students might indicate a data issue
- Zero new students for extended periods might indicate connection problems
- Error messages in the processing details need attention

## Common Tasks

### Checking if the System is Working

1. **Look for today's log file** in `Scripts/Logs/`
2. **Check your email** for the daily report
3. **Verify new PDF files** are being created in `StudentsByYearLevel/`
4. **Confirm timestamps** on files are recent

### Adding New Email Recipients

1. **Open `config.json`**
2. **Find the `"To"` line under EmailNotification**
3. **Add emails separated by semicolons:**
   ```json
   "To": "admin@school.vic.edu.au;ict@school.vic.edu.au;principal@school.vic.edu.au"
   ```
4. **Save the file**

### Changing When Cleanup Runs

1. **Open `config.json`**
2. **Find `"RunOnDayOfWeek"` under CleanupSettings**
3. **Change to desired day:**
   ```json
   "RunOnDayOfWeek": "Friday"
   ```
4. **Save the file**

### Temporarily Disabling the System

1. **Open `config.json`**
2. **Set MockMode to true:**
   ```json
   "MockMode": true
   ```
3. **This will simulate operations without making real changes**
